## Working with  QIIME2 in command line

follow the QIIME2 tutorial ALWAYS!!!

these are a few items as cheat sheet:

On the terminal, you are working with qiime only if you see the following prompt:  
    `(qiime2-2020.8) LAPPSCI279BIO:qiime2-moving-pictures-tutorial mgoytia$`

If you do not have the (qiime2-2020.8) preceding your prompt you must start qiime:  
    `conda activate qiime2-2020.8`
