## Welcome to the Goytia Lab: Antibiotic resistance in Commensal _Neisseria spp_ 

You can access [my Lab website](https://goytia-researchlab.weebly.com/) to see what is going on with our research project at [Spelman College](https://www.spelman.edu/).

You can access the Independent Research (BIO487) course on [Research on Microbiomes and impact of disruptions here](https://github.com/mgoytia1/lab_home/blob/master/bio487_week1).

### Dr. Goytia's background

I am a microbiology researcher interested in the evolution of bacteria, and their capacity to adapt to chemical insults, such as antibiotics. My primary line of research is understanding how Neisseria species resist antibiotics and how they form biofilms.
